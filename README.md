# MARVINETTE v1.0
A 42 Piscine exercise tester by jszabo

This is a very basic project tester program for the Piscine @ 42 Paris.
It is not a finished project, and since it has been made purely out of fun,
it is extremely likely that it never will be.

Currently supported projects:

Day03
Day04 (until ex07)
Day05 (until ex19)

USAGE:
----------------------------------------------

Step 1.

Clone the repo somewhere that is NOT your day project folder.

$> git clone https://github.com/JohnSzaboJr/marvinette.git amazing_marvinette

Step 2.

Copy the contents of the repo (with the exception of the README) to your
day project folder. In effect this means the tester program named "marvinette", and it's supporting folder, named "marvinette_files". Write something like this:

$> pwd

/Users/user/amazing_marvinette

$> mv m* ./Piscine/Day03/

Step 3.

Run the marvinette with the name of the project, given to it as parameter:

$> ./marvinette d03

That's it! Happy swimming, and good luck!

P.S.: Currently the test only tells you if your file passed the test or not.
It doesn't tell you how you failed, or what's wrong with your code. Maybe this
will be changed in the future, maybe not. More likely, not. So it is your
responsibility to look for the error. You can gain some insight by looking
at the test files in "marvinette_files". Easy-peasy!

P.P.S.: For those of you who don't get it, "marvinette" is a pun name, playing
on the similarity with "moulinette" and "norminette", added to it the name of
the depressed robot in Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. Ugh, it's quite cringy
spelled out like this. It's not a good pun, and it doesn't have to be. But if
you haven't read the books yet, I suggest you do before you start your actual 
cursus. You will get some insight into Life, the Universe, and Everything... 
Or at least you will have some more respect for white mice and dolphins.
